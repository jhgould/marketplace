# Application Flow

# User Sign-In Flow Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the user sign-in and sign-up process for the application, which leverages Devise for authentication and includes additional functionality such as phone number verification and address normalization to enable apartment buildings to be searched by address.

## User Table Schema

The `users` table includes the following columns:

- `full_name`: string, not null
- `email`: string, not null, unique
- `password`: encrypted string, not null
- `phone`: encrypted string, not null
- `address`: encrypted string, not null
- `unit_number`: string, nullable
- `stripe_account_id`: string, nullable
- `apartment_id`: integer, foreign key, nullable
- `verified_at`: timestamp, nullable

## Sign-Up Flow

### Step 1: Initial Sign-Up Form

1. The user navigates to the sign-up page.
2. They fill out their email and password.
3. Devise checks if the email already exists in the database:
   - **Existing User**: The user is prompted to log in.
   - **New User**: They are routed to a second form to complete their profile.

### Step 2: Profile Completion Form

The user is prompted to provide the following additional information:

- First name 
- Last name 
- Phone number
- Address
- Unit number (optional)

#### Phone Number Verification

1. The phone number is verified using Twilio SMS.
2. A verification code is sent to the user‚Äôs phone.
3. The user enters the code to confirm their phone number.

#### Address Normalization

1. The address submitted by the user is normalized using the Google Geocoding API.
2. The normalized address is checked against the database for existing apartments:
   - **Apartment Found**: The user is prompted to join the existing apartment.
   - **No Apartment Found**:
     - An admin is notified to create a new apartment.
     - The user is notified via email that their submitted address is under review.

### Step 3: Completion

Once the profile is completed:

1. The user is routed to the home page.
2. They receive an email explaining the status of their apartment association.

## Sign-In Flow

1. The user navigates to the sign-in page.
2. They enter their email and password.
3. If the credentials are valid, the user is routed to the user dashboard.

## Notifications

### Admin Notifications

- Triggered when a new address is submitted with no associated apartment.
- Includes user details and the submitted address.

### User Notifications

- **Email Confirmation**: Upon successful profile completion.
- **Apartment Status Update**: When an admin creates an apartment for their submitted address.

## Summary of External Integrations

- **Devise**: For authentication and session management.
- **Twilio SMS**: For phone number verification.
- **Google Geocoding API**: For address normalization.

## Future Enhancements

- Streamline admin notifications for quicker apartment creation.
- Implement real-time updates for users on their apartment status.
- Enhance address verification with additional validation layers.
